## Generic Personas

This page includes a depiction of end-users and related stakeholders as introduced in the [WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunizations](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/380303).

The specific roles and demographic profile of the personas will vary depending on the setting, the generic personas are based on the WHO core competencies and credentials of different health worker personas.

Illustrative examples of immunization user personas for individuals are included in the [Better Immunization Data (BID) Initiative Product Vision](https://www.path.org/resources/product-vision-for-the-better-immunization-data-bid-initiative/).

### Targeted generic personas

The targeted personas for the Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunizations are health professionals operating in care settings that are able to provide the required essential interventions for immunization delivery. Their key competencies are defined in the following table.
