## Decision-support logic

This page describes the decision support logic included in the [WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunizations](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/380303).

The decision-support logic component provides the decision logic and algorithms, as well as the scheduling of services, in accordance with WHO guidelines. The decision logic and algorithms in this implementation guide deconstruct the recommendations within the Immunization guidelines and guidance into a machine readable format that clearly labels the inputs and outputs that would be operationalized in a digital decision-support system.

### Decision Support Logic Overview

The table below provides an overview of the decision-support tables and algorithms for the different business processes in an EIR. The structure of the decision-support tables is based on an adaptation of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN™), an industry standard for modelling and executing decision logic. These decision-support tables detail the business rules, data inputs and outputs to support EIR business processes.

Immunization schedules vary by vaccine product, epidemiological situation, and national policies. The decision-support logic and scheduling logic in the DAK were curated based on the WHO recommended immunizations schedules and related position papers. Because of this, there are decision-support table “options” and scheduling-logic “options” based on the various immunization strategies outlined in the recommendations that countries can choose and adapt as relevant.
