Children aged between 1 year and 7 years who have not \n  previously been vaccinated should receive 3 doses of vaccine following a 0, 1, 6-month schedule. Two subsequent booster \n  doses using tetanus toxoid with reduced diphtheria toxoid (Td) or Td with acellular pertussis (TdaP) combination vaccines \n  are needed with an interval of at least 1 year between doses.  For those starting a tetanus and diphtheria-containing \n  vaccination series in adolescence or adulthood: from 7 years of age only Td combinations should be used. Age-appropriate \n  combinations-containing pertussis vaccine with reduced diphtheria toxoid are also available. If tetanus vaccination is \n  started during adolescence or adulthood, a total of only 5 appropriately spaced doses are required to obtain lifelong \n  protection.  Pregnant women and their newborn infants are protected from birth-associated tetanus if the mother received \n  either 6 tetanus-containing vaccine doses during childhood or 5 doses if first vaccinated during adolescence/adulthood \n  (documented by card, immunization registry and/or history) before the time of reproductive age. Vaccination history should \n  be verified in order to determine whether a dose of tetanus-containing vaccine is needed in the current pregnancy.  In \n  countries where maternal and neonatal tetanus remains a public health problem, pregnant women for whom reliable information \n  on previous tetanus vaccinations is not available should receive at least 2 doses of tetanus-containing vaccines, preferably \n  Td, with an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses and the second dose at least 2 weeks before the birth. To ensure \n  protection for a minimum of 5 years, a third dose should be given at least 6 months later. A fourth and fifth dose should \n  be given at intervals of at least 1 year, or in subsequent pregnancies, in order to ensure lifelong protection.  In \n  countries where maternal and neonatal tetanus is not a public health problem (low prevalence/high-income settings), \n  policy-makers may choose not to include tetanus vaccination among antenatal care interventions if effective tetanus \n  immunization programmes and good post-exposure prophylaxis exist outside of pregnancy. In countries where maternal \n  and neonatal tetanus is not a public health problem, the strategy may be to protect against tetanus via the infant \n  (3 DTP-containing vaccinations) and boosters programme. For more information, see the WHO guide Protecting all against \n  tetanus (5).  For children aged under 7 years, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) or DTaP \n  combinations may be used.

A fourth and fifth dose should \n  be given at intervals of at least 1 year, or in subsequent pregnancies, in order to ensure lifelong protection.  In \n  countries where maternal and neonatal tetanus is not a public health problem (low prevalence/high-income settings), \n  policy-makers may choose not to include tetanus vaccination among antenatal care interventions if effective tetanus \n  immunization programmes and good post-exposure prophylaxis exist outside of pregnancy. In countries where maternal \n  and neonatal tetanus is not a public health problem, the strategy may be to protect against tetanus via the infant \n  (3 DTP-containing vaccinations) and boosters programme. For more information, see the WHO guide Protecting all against \n  tetanus (5).  For children aged under 7 years, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) or DTaP \n  combinations may be used. For children aged 4 years and older, Td-containing vaccine may be used and is preferred. For \n  children aged 7 years and older, only Td combinations should be used. Age-appropriate combinations-containing pertussis \n  vaccine with low-dose diphtheria antigen are also available. Only aP-containing vaccines should be used for vaccination \n  of persons aged 7 years and older."

      "valueMarkdown" : "The duration of protection following primary immunization varies considerably \n   depending upon factors such as local epidemiology, vaccination schedule and choice of vaccine. Therefore, a booster \n   dose is recommended for children aged 1–6 years, preferably during the second year of life (≥ 6 months after last \n   primary dose), unless otherwise indicated by local epidemiology; the contact could also be used to catch up on any \n   missed doses of other vaccines.  This schedule should provide protection for at least 6 years for countries using \n   wP-containing vaccine. For countries using aP-containing vaccine, protection may decline appreciably before 6 years \n   of age. Only aP-containing vaccines should be used for vaccination of persons aged 7 years and older.  Although a \n   booster dose in adolescence was shown to decrease disease in adolescents, this is not generally recommended as a \n   means of controlling pertussis in infants. A decision to introduce adolescent and/or adult boosters should only \n   be taken after careful assessment of local epidemiology, estimation of the contribution of adolescents as source \n   of infections of young infants, and selection of adolescents and/or adults as target groups for vaccination. Decisions \n   concerning such programmes should be based on the incidence and cost–effectiveness data. High coverage of routine \n   immunization in infants must be in place prior to the introduction of vaccination of adolescents and adults. "
