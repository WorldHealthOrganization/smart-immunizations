Although 1 booster dose should result in a rapid increase in antibody, the level of tetanus-specific antibodies in women who received only a 3-dose primary series during infancy is similar to that of unimmunized individuals 15 years post-immunization. Therefore, 2 doses are recommended to ensure a total of 5 doses before delivery. Women who received 4 tetanus-containing vaccine doses during childhood or pre-adulthood need only 1 booster dose, which should be given at the first opportunity.

Although 1 booster dose should result in a rapid increase in antibody, the level of tetanus-specific antibodies in women who received only a 3-dose primary series during infancy is similar to that of unimmunized individuals 15 years post-immunization. Therefore, 2 doses are recommended to ensure a total of 5 doses before delivery. Women who received 4 tetanus-containing vaccine doses during childhood or pre-adulthood need only 1 booster dose, which should be given at the first opportunity.
