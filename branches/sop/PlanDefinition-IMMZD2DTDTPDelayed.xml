      <valueMarkdown value="Delayed or interrupted DTP-containing series: for children whose vaccination series has been interrupted, &#xA;  the series should be resumed without repeating previous doses. Children aged between 1 year and 7 years who have not &#xA;  previously been vaccinated should receive 3 doses of vaccine following a 0, 1, 6-month schedule. Two subsequent booster &#xA;  doses using tetanus toxoid with reduced diphtheria toxoid (Td) or Td with acellular pertussis (TdaP) combination vaccines &#xA;  are needed with an interval of at least 1 year between doses.  For those starting a tetanus and diphtheria-containing &#xA;  vaccination series in adolescence or adulthood: from 7 years of age only Td combinations should be used. Age-appropriate &#xA;  combinations-containing pertussis vaccine with reduced diphtheria toxoid are also available. If tetanus vaccination is &#xA;  started during adolescence or adulthood, a total of only 5 appropriately spaced doses are required to obtain lifelong &#xA;  protection.  Pregnant women and their newborn infants are protected from birth-associated tetanus if the mother received &#xA;  either 6 tetanus-containing vaccine doses during childhood or 5 doses if first vaccinated during adolescence/adulthood &#xA;  (documented by card, immunization registry and/or history) before the time of reproductive age. Vaccination history should &#xA;  be verified in order to determine whether a dose of tetanus-containing vaccine is needed in the current pregnancy.  In &#xA;  countries where maternal and neonatal tetanus remains a public health problem, pregnant women for whom reliable information &#xA;  on previous tetanus vaccinations is not available should receive at least 2 doses of tetanus-containing vaccines, preferably &#xA;  Td, with an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses and the second dose at least 2 weeks before the birth. To ensure &#xA;  protection for a minimum of 5 years, a third dose should be given at least 6 months later. A fourth and fifth dose should &#xA;  be given at intervals of at least 1 year, or in subsequent pregnancies, in order to ensure lifelong protection.  In &#xA;  countries where maternal and neonatal tetanus is not a public health problem (low prevalence/high-income settings), &#xA;  policy-makers may choose not to include tetanus vaccination among antenatal care interventions if effective tetanus &#xA;  immunization programmes and good post-exposure prophylaxis exist outside of pregnancy. In countries where maternal &#xA;  and neonatal tetanus is not a public health problem, the strategy may be to protect against tetanus via the infant &#xA;  (3 DTP-containing vaccinations) and boosters programme. For more information, see the WHO guide Protecting all against &#xA;  tetanus (5).  For children aged under 7 years, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) or DTaP &#xA;  combinations may be used. For children aged 4 years and older, Td-containing vaccine may be used and is preferred. For &#xA;  children aged 7 years and older, only Td combinations should be used. Age-appropriate combinations-containing pertussis &#xA;  vaccine with low-dose diphtheria antigen are also available. Only aP-containing vaccines should be used for vaccination &#xA;  of persons aged 7 years and older."/>

      <valueMarkdown value="The duration of protection following primary immunization varies considerably &#xA;   depending upon factors such as local epidemiology, vaccination schedule and choice of vaccine. Therefore, a booster &#xA;   dose is recommended for children aged 1–6 years, preferably during the second year of life (≥ 6 months after last &#xA;   primary dose), unless otherwise indicated by local epidemiology; the contact could also be used to catch up on any &#xA;   missed doses of other vaccines.  This schedule should provide protection for at least 6 years for countries using &#xA;   wP-containing vaccine. For countries using aP-containing vaccine, protection may decline appreciably before 6 years &#xA;   of age. Only aP-containing vaccines should be used for vaccination of persons aged 7 years and older.  Although a &#xA;   booster dose in adolescence was shown to decrease disease in adolescents, this is not generally recommended as a &#xA;   means of controlling pertussis in infants. A decision to introduce adolescent and/or adult boosters should only &#xA;   be taken after careful assessment of local epidemiology, estimation of the contribution of adolescents as source &#xA;   of infections of young infants, and selection of adolescents and/or adults as target groups for vaccination. Decisions &#xA;   concerning such programmes should be based on the incidence and cost–effectiveness data. High coverage of routine &#xA;   immunization in infants must be in place prior to the introduction of vaccination of adolescents and adults. "/>
