<div class="markdown-toc">

</div>
<p>This page provides an overview of illustrative functional requirements that may be considered to kick-start the process of designing or adapting the immunization information system (IIS) digital tracking and decision-support system.</p>

<p>Functional requirements describe the capabilities the system must have in order to meet the end-users’ needs and achieve tasks within the business process.</p>

<p>These requirements are taken from Component 8 and Web Annex D of the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit: SMART Guidelines for Immunizations (link forthcoming).</p>

<p>Please note that these are not exhaustive lists and should be modified according to context and user persona needs.</p>
