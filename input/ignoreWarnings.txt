# Tried to resolve this but using pin-canonicals caused issues with the content in the depended IG.
# Also tried using the version in the FSH file, but it didn't keep it for the profile with InstanceOf.
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/StructureDefinition/cpg-immunizationactivity'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '2.0.0', found versions: 1.0.0, 2.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/StructureDefinition/cpg-immunizationactivity' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/StructureDefinition/cpg-immunizationactivity|2.0.0'
