For children, inactivated hepatitis A-containing vaccines can be given as a single-dose or 2-dose schedule, and administered intramuscularly.
For adults aged over 40 years, vaccination with inactivated vaccines using the 2-dose schedule is preferred since there is insufficient evidence on the immunogenicity and long-term protection from a single dose in this age group.
With a 2-dose schedule, the first dose should be given from ≥ 12 months of age. """
