Since perinatal or early postnatal transmission is the most important source of chronic hepatitis B virus infection globally\, all infants including low-birth-weight and premature infants should receive their first dose of hepatitis B-containing vaccine as soon as possible after birth\, ideally within 24 hours.\n\nIf administration within 24 hours is not feasible\, a late birth dose has some effectiveness. WHO recommends that all infants receive the late birth dose during the first contact with health-care providers at any time up to the time of the next dose of the primary schedule.  """)
