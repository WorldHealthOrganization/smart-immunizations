  * title = Three booster doses of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine should be provided during childhood and adolescence. The diphtheria booster doses should be given in combination with tetanus toxoid using the same schedule (i.e at 12–23 months of age, 4–7 years of age and 9–15 years of age, using age-appropriate vaccine formulations). Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses. Member States may update this schedule based on their country context.

For children aged under 7 years, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) combinations may be used.
For children aged 4 years and older, tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid (Td)-containing vaccine may be used and is preferred.
From 7 years of age, only Td combinations should be used.
Age-appropriate combinations-containing pertussis vaccine with low-dose diphtheria antigen are also available. Only aP-containing vaccines should be used for vaccination of persons aged 7 years and older.

National vaccination schedules can be adjusted within the age limits specified above to enable programmes to tailor their schedules based on local epidemiology, the objectives of the immunization programme, any particular programmatic issues and to better align tetanus vaccination with the immunological requirements of other vaccines (particularly for pertussis and diphtheria).

  * title = A pertussis booster dose is recommended for children aged 1–6 years, preferably during the second year of life (≥ 6 months after last primary dose), unless otherwise indicated by local epidemiology; the contact could also be used to catch up on any missed doses of other vaccines. This schedule should provide protection for at least 6 years for countries using wP-containing vaccine. For countries using aP-containing vaccine, protection may decline appreciably before 6 years of age.

Only aP-containing vaccines should be used for vaccination of persons aged 7 years and over. Although a booster dose in adolescence has been shown to decrease disease in adolescents, this is not generally recommended as a means of controlling pertussis in infants.
