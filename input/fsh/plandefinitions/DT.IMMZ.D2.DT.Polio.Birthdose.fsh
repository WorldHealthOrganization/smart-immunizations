The zero dose of bOPV should be administered at birth\, or within the first week of life\, to maximize seroconversion rates following subsequent doses and to induce mucosal protection before enteric pathogens may interfere with the immune response. \nAdditionally\, a birth dose of bOPV administered while infants are still protected by maternally_x0002_derived antibodies up to 6 months may prevent vaccine-associated paralytic polio VAPP.
