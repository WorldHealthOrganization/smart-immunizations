The schedule is for a 2-site intradermal vaccine administered on days 0 and 7. If intramuscular administration is used, WHO recommends a 1-site intramuscular vaccine administration on days 0 and 7.

Note: This PrEP dose is recommended for individuals at high risk of rabies virus exposure. These include subpopulations in highly endemic settings with limited access to timely and adequate PrEP, individuals at occupational risk and travellers who may be at risk of exposure. WHO recommendations apply only to inactivated modern, concentrated, purified cell culture and embryonated egg-based rabies vaccines (CCEEVs). """
