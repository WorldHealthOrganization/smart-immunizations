For all countries using OPV in their national immunization programme, WHO recommends 3 doses of bOPV and 2 doses of IPV. 
The preferred schedule is to administer the 3 doses of bOPV starting from the minimum age of 6 weeks, with at least a 4 week-interval between doses. The first IPV dose should be administered from a minimum of 14 weeks of age (with the third dose of the diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis vaccine [DTP3] or pentavalent vaccine [penta3]), with the second IPV dose being given at least 4 months later (possibly coinciding with other vaccines administered at 9 months of age).

Note: Based on local epidemiology, programmatic implications and feasibility of delivery, countries may choose an alternative “early IPV schedule” starting with the first IPV dose at 6 weeks of age (with DTP1/penta1) and the second IPV dose at 14 weeks (with DTP3/penta3). """

The preferred schedule is to administer the 3 doses of bOPV starting from the minimum age of 6 weeks, with at least a 4 week-interval between doses.

Note: Based on local epidemiology, programmatic implications and feasibility of delivery, countries may choose an alternative “early IPV schedule” starting with the first IPV dose at 6 weeks of age (with DTP1/penta1), and the second IPV dose at 14 weeks (with DTP3/penta3). """
