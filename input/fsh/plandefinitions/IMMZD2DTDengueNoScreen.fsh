"""]], [["""Currently, the dengue vaccine should be used within the indicated age range, which in 
most countries is 9â€“45 years. 

If pre-vaccination screening is not feasible, vaccination without individual screening could be 
considered in areas with recent documentation of seroprevalence rates of at least 80% by age 9 
years. Communication needs to ensure appropriate and full disclosure of the risks of vaccination 
of persons with unknown serostatus.

CYD-TDV is recommended as a 3-dose series given 6 months apart. Should a vaccine dose be delayed 
for any reason, it is not necessary to restart the course and the next dose in the series should 
be administered as soon as possible.
