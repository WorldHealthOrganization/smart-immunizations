  * action[output]
  * title = Pregnant women who have received only 3 doses of tetanus-containing vaccines during childhood without booster doses should receive 2 doses of tetanus-containing vaccines at the earliest opportunity during pregnancy with a minimal interval of 4 weeks between doses and the second dose at least 2 weeks before giving birth. To provide lifelong protection, a sixth dose would be needed at least 1 year after the fifth dose, or during the next pregnancy.

From 7 years of age, only tetanus toxoid with reduced diphtheria toxoid (Td) combinations should be used. Age-appropriate combinations-containing pertussis vaccine with low-dose diphtheria antigen are also available. Only aP-containing vaccines should be used for vaccination of persons aged 7 years and older.
