          If the Japanese encephalitis (JE) risk is sufficient to warrant vaccination of pregnant women, inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccines should be used preferentially over live attenuated or live recombinant vaccines based on the general precautionary principle against using live vaccines in pregnant women, especially if alternative types of vaccines are available. Pregnancy testing is not a prerequisite for JE vaccination. Inadvertent administration of live attenuated or live recombinant JE vaccine to a pregnant woman is not an indication for termination of the pregnancy.
