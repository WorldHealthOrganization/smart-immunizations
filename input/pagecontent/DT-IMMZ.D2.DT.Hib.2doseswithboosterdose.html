          Because serious Hib disease occurs most commonly in children aged between 4 months and 18 months, immunization should start from 6 weeks of age, or as early as possible thereafter.
The interval between doses should be at least 8 weeks if 2 primary doses are given.
Hib-containing vaccine is not required for healthy children aged over 5 years.
