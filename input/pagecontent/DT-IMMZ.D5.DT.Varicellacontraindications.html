          Varicella-containing vaccine is usually contraindicated in persons with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies. However, due to the increased severity of varicella in certain groups of immunocompromised persons, varicella vaccination (2 doses) may be considered in these groups. Use of monovalent vaccine in these populations should only be considered in health-care settings where specific antiviral therapy against varicella is readily available and physicians have expertise with the vaccine in these patients. MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) has not been tested and is contraindicated in immunocompromised persons.
