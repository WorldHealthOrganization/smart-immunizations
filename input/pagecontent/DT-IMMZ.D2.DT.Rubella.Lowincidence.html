          Live vaccines should be given either simultaneously with rubella-containing vaccines, or at least 4 weeks apart. An exception to this is oral poliovirus vaccine, which can be given at any time before or after rubella-containing vaccines without interfering in the response to either vaccine. WHO recommends co-administration of rubella-containing vaccine and yellow fever-containing vaccines.
