The following page provides a reference to resources that can guide
countries in adapting the guidelines for country use.

To implement WHO recommendations in country settings, governments must
interpret and then adapt the content in line with local policies,
procedures, and digital tools.

This implementation guide provides the generic content required in
digital systems, independently of a specific software application and
with the intention that countries can adapt it to meet local
needs.

WHO guidelines articulate and endorse rigorously tested recommendations
for health interventions to be adopted within country programs. When
applied correctly and consistently, guideline recommendations save
lives. To ensure that countries can effectively benefit from digital
health investments, the SMART Guidelines approach is intended to
facilitate the accurate reflection of WHO's clinical, public health and
data use guidelines in the digital systems that countries are adopting.
