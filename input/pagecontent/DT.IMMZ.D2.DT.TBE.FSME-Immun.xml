          For both vaccines (FSME-Immun and Encepur), the manufacturers recommend a booster dose to be administered 3 years after completion of the primary series. Although there is a strong indication that the spacing of boosters could be expanded considerably from the intervals currently recommended by the manufacturers (every 3–5 years), the evidence is still insufficient for a definitive recommendation on the optimal frequency and number of booster doses.

          Vaccination against the disease requires a primary series of 3 doses; those who will continue to be at risk should probably have ≥1 booster doses. Although there is a strong indication that the spacing of boosters could be expanded considerably from the intervals currently recommended by the manufacturers (every 3–5 years), the evidence is still insufficient for a definitive recommendation on the optimal frequency and number of booster doses.
