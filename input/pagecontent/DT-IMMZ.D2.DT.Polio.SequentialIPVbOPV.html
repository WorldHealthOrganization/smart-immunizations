          For sequential IPV– bOPV schedules, WHO recommends that the first dose of IPV be given starting from 8 weeks of age with an interval of 4–8 weeks before administration of the second IPV dose. This should be followed by at least 2 doses of bOPV separated by 4–8 weeks depending on the risk of exposure to poliovirus in early childhood.
Where a sequential IPV–bOPV schedule is used, the initial administration of 2 doses of IPV should be followed by ≥2 doses of bOPV to ensure sufficient levels of protection in the intestinal mucosa as well as a decrease in the burden of vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP).
