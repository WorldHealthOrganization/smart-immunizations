          Pregnant women and their newborn infants are protected from birth-associated tetanus if the mother received either 6 tetanus-containing vaccine doses during childhood or 5 doses if first vaccinated during adolescence/adulthood (documented by card, immunization registry and/or history) before the time of reproductive age.
 
In countries where maternal and neonatal tetanus remains a public health problem, pregnant women for whom reliable information on previous tetanus vaccinations is not available should receive at least 2 doses of tetanus-containing vaccines, preferably tetanus toxoid with reduced diphtheria toxoid (Td), with an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses and the second dose at least 2 weeks before the birth. To ensure protection for a minimum of 5 years, a third dose should be given at least 6 months later. A fourth and fifth dose should be given at intervals of at least 1 year, or in subsequent pregnancies, to ensure lifelong protection.

          Pregnant women who have received only 3 doses of tetanus-containing vaccines during childhood without booster doses should receive 2 doses of tetanus-containing vaccines at the earliest opportunity during pregnancy with a minimal interval of 4 weeks between doses and the second dose at least 2 weeks before giving birth. Although 1 booster dose should result in a rapid increase in antibody, the level of tetanus-specific antibodies in women who received only a 3-dose primary series during infancy is similar to that of unimmunized individuals 15 years post-immunization. Therefore, 2 doses are recommended to ensure a total of 5 doses before delivery. Women who received 4 tetanus-containing vaccine doses during childhood or pre-adulthood need only 1 booster dose, which should be given at the first opportunity. In both scenarios, to provide lifelong protection, a sixth dose would be needed at least 1 year after the fifth dose.
