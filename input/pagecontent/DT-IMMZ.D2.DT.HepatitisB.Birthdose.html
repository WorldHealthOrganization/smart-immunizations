          Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all children worldwide. Since perinatal or early postnatal transmission is the most important source of chronic hepatitis B virus infection globally, all infants (including low-birth-weight and premature infants) should receive their first dose of hepatitis B-containing vaccine as soon as possible after birth, ideally within 24 hours.

If administration within 24 hours is not feasible, a late birth dose has some effectiveness. WHO recommends that all infants receive the late birth dose during the first contact with health-care providers at any time up to the time of the next dose of the primary schedule.
