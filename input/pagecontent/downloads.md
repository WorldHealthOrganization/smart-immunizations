### Package

This is the technical package containing the artifacts in this Implementation Guide:

* [IG Package](package.tgz)

### Definitions

In addition to the above, we have provided format-specific _definitions_:

* [XML](definitions.xml.zip)
* [JSON](definitions.json.zip)
* [TTL](definitions.ttl.zip)

    These files should be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts since they contain all of the rules about what makes these profiles valid.
    Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the specification and profiles that apply in order to make a conformant implementation.
    See the overview on [validating FHIR profiles and resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/validation.html) for more information about validating profiles and how to use these artifacts.


### Examples

    All examples used in this Implementation Guide:

* [XML](examples.xml.zip)
* [JSON](examples.json.zip)
* [TTL](examples.ttl.zip)
