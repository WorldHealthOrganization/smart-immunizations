This page details indicators and performance metrics that would be
aggregated from core data elements identified . The FHIR Measure is used
to describe the indicator in a computable format. These indicators may
be aggregated automatically from the digital tracking tool to populate a
digital health management information system (HMIS). This table is also
available in [Web Annex C]{.mark}.

The tables below show the data elements and highlight some of the
measures those are applied in from this IG. For a complete list of

**Indicator Table Data Element Descriptions**

| Data Element | Description |
|----|----|
|Numerator definition|The description of numerator used to calculate the indicator.|
|Numerator computation|The calculation or how to derive this numerator. Any specific data elements noted here should align directly with the individual-level Data Element Name.|
|Denominator definition|The dglossescription of denominator used to calculate the indicator.|
|Denominator computation|The calculation or how to derive this denominator. Any specific data elements noted here should align directly with the individual-level Data Element Name.|
|Disaggregations|Are there any dis-aggregations that you would like to be able to do in order to conduct the necessary analysis?|
|References|If there are any national or global guidelines (e.g. WHO guidelines) that dictate how and why this indicator should be calculated or reported, it should be noted here. If any guidelines or recommendations change, having a clear reference listed would help in updating or restructuring your data.|
