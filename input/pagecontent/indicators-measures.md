The FHIR Measure is used to describe the indicator in a computable format. These indicators may be aggregated automatically from the digital tracking tool to populate a digital health management information system (HMIS). 

The table below shows the measures that are included in this IG. The table with Measures is also available in the [Artifact Index](artifacts.html)

For the operational descriptions of indicators and references, see the Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK): SMART Guidelines for Immunizations, including Web Annex C of the DAK.
