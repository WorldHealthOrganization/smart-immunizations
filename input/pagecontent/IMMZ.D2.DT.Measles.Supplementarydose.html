          An additional dose of MCV should be administered to children infected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) following immune reconstitution. If CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are monitored, an additional dose of MCV should be administered when immune reconstitution has been achieved (e.g. when the CD4+ T lymphocyte count reaches 20–25%). Where CD4+ T lymphocyte monitoring is not available, children should receive an additional dose of MCV 6–12 months after initiation of HAART.
As a general rule, live vaccines should be given either simultaneously or at intervals of 4 weeks. An exception to this rule is oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), which can be given at any time before or after measles vaccination without interference in the response to either vaccine.
