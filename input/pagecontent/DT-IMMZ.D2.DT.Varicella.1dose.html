One dose is sufficient to reduce mortality and severe morbidity from varicella but not to prevent limited virus circulation and outbreaks. Two doses have higher effectiveness and should therefore be recommended in countries where the programmatic goal is, in addition to decreasing mortality and severe morbidity, to further reduce the number of cases and outbreaks.</span></td><td class="output">Care Plan</td><td class="output">Guidance displayed to health worker</td><td class="output">Annotations</td><td class="output">Reference(s)</td></tr><tr class="rule"><td class="row-label"></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong><a href="CodeSystem-DT.html#:~:text=1-dose schedule">1-dose schedule</a></strong><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 1-dose schedule</span>:
