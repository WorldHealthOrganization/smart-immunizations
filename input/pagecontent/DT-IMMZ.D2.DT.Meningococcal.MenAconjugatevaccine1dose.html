          For MenA conjugate vaccine (5µg), a 1-dose schedule is recommended at 9–18 months of age based on local programmatic and epidemiologic considerations. 
Any children who miss vaccination at the recommended age should be vaccinated as soon as possible thereafter.
MenAfriVac 5 µg should be used for routine immunization of infants and young children aged 3 to 24 months. 
MenAfriVac 10 µg should be used for catch-up and periodic campaigns from 12 months of age onwards.
