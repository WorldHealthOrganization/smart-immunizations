          Pregnant women who received 4 tetanus-containing vaccines doses during childhood or pre-adulthood need only 1 booster dose, which should be given at the first opportunity. To provide lifelong protection, a sixth dose would be needed at least 1 year after the fifth dose, or during the next pregnancy.

From 7 years of age, only tetanus toxoid with reduced diphtheria toxoid (Td) combinations should be used. Age-appropriate combinations-containing pertussis vaccine with reduced diphtheria toxoid are also available. Only acellular pertussis (aP)-containing vaccines should be used for vaccination of persons aged 7 years and older.
