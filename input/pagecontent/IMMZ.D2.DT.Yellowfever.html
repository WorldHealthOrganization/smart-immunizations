          In endemic countries, it is recommended that yellow fever vaccine be given to children aged 9–12 months at the same time as the measles vaccine. Preventive mass vaccination campaigns are recommended for inhabitants of areas at risk of yellow fever where there is low vaccination coverage.

Vaccination should be provided to everyone aged 9 months and older in any area with reported cases.

Vaccination should also be offered if the individual is travelling to and from at-risk areas, if not contraindicated.

As a general rule, any live vaccine may be given either simultaneously or at an interval of 4 weeks. Oral poliovirus vaccine may be given at any time in relation to yellow fever vaccination.
