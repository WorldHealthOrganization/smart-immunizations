This page describes the business processes included in the WHO Digital
Adaptation Kit (DAK) <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark> (link forthcoming). 
For full details, see the published DAK content.

A business process, or process, is a set of related activities or tasks 
performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, 
such as registration, counselling, referrals. Workflows are a visual 
representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) 
that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a “story” 
for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication 
and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers.

The DAK for <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark> focuses on key business processes <nark>insert content here</mark>.
