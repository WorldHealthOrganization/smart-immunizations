          bOPV is contraindicated in severely immunocompromised patients with known underlying conditions. Such conditions include disorders of the thymus, symptomatic HIV infection or low CD4 T cell values, malignant neoplasm treated with chemotherapy, recent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, drugs with known immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory properties (e.g. high-dose systemic corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, TNFα inhibitors, IL-1 blocking agent or other monoclonal antibodies targeting immune cells), and current or recent radiation therapies targeting immune cells. These populations can safely receive IPV.
