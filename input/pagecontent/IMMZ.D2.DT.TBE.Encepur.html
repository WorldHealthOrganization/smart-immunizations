          For the conventional vaccination schedule the dose interval is 1–3 months between doses 1 and 2. For Encepur, the accelerated schedule requires vaccination on days 0 and 14, followed by a third dose delivered 9–12 months later. In addition, Encepur may be used on a rapid schedule, with vaccination on days 0, 7 and 21, followed by a fourth dose delivered 12–18 months later.

          Vaccination against the disease requires a primary series of 3 doses; those who will continue to be at risk should probably have ≥1 booster doses. Although there is a strong indication that the spacing of boosters could be expanded considerably from the intervals currently recommended by the manufacturers (every 3–5 years), the evidence is still insufficient for a definitive recommendation on the optimal frequency and number of booster doses.
