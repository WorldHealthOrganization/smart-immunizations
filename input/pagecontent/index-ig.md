### Summary 
This implementation guide includes a machine-readable representation of WHO guidelines for <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark>, as documented in the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark> (link forthcoming) and explicitly encodes computer-interoperable logic, including data models, terminologies, and logic expressions, in a computable language to support implementation of <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark> use cases by WHO Member States.

The guide is part of the [WHO SMART Guidelines approach](https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines) to support countries to integrate WHO global health and data recommendations into digital systems accurately and consistently. It defines a series of FHIR Resources, Profiles, Extensions, and Terminology based on the WHO <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark> Digital Adaptation Kit (link forthcoming). 

Supporting guidance, recommendations, resources, and standards are included in the <a href="references.html">References</a> and <a href="dependencies.html">Dependencies</a>.

### About this implementation guide

This implementation guide is broken into the following levels of [knowledge representation](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/documentation-approach-06-01-levels-of-knowledge-representation.html):
- <a href="index.html">Home</a> - contains references to the guidance, guidelines, policies and recommendations underpinning this implementation guide.
- <a href="business-requirements.html">Business Requirements</a> - contains the requirements for this implementation guide including the definition of key concepts, use cases, and a data dictionary.      
- <a href="data-models-and-exchange.html">Data Models and Exchange</a> - contains the data models and data exchange protocols with actors and transactions defined.
- <a href="deployment.html">Deployment Guidance </a> - contains relevant technical specifications and guidance, testing resources, reference implementation materials, and supporting guidance for adaptation to local contexts.

This guide is prepared to facilitate digital implementation of WHO <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark> guidelines by providing FHIR-based computable representations of and implementation guidance for using the key components of the WHO <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark> digital adaptation kit (DAK):

* Health Interventions & Recommendations
* Generic Personas
* User Scenarios
* Business Processes & Workflows
* Core Data Elements
* Decision Support Logic
* Indicators & Monitoring
* Functional & Non-functional Requirements

This guide is a companion to the Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) and should be used side-by-side with it. Implementers are strongly encouraged to make use of the Digital Adaptation Kit. The focus of this guide is on the explanation and use of the computable artifacts.

This guide assumes use of the following resources: 
* [IPS Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Patient-uv-ips)
* [CPG ActivityDefinitions](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/artifacts.html#activitydefinition-index)

- For a complete listing of the artifacts defined in this implementation guide, refer to the [Artifact Index](artifacts.html).
- A complete offline copy of this implementation guide can be found on the [Downloads](downloads.html) page.

- This Implementation Guide makes use of [Clinical Quality Language](https://cql.hl7.org/) for the decision support artifacts including the PlanDefinitions and Measures. They are used to express how a calculation should occur and can be used with a CQL engine in order to process the decision or indicator directly from the applicable FHIR resources. Links to this specification, the FHIR Clinical Practice Guidelines Speciciation, and other helpful resources can be found in the Support dropdown.
