This section contains the data models and data exchange protocols with actors and transactions defined. It is part of the L3 machine-readable knowledge representation.

The pages included in this section are described below. 

- [**Actors**](actors.html) - A list and description of software or human entities that interact with the system, derived from business requirements defined in the L2. 
- [**Sequence Diagrams**](sequence-diagrams.html) - Sequence diagrams depicting the interactions between system actors, in order, derived from business processes in the L2.
- [**Transactions**](transactions.html) - A defined list of system transactions at an atomic level for each actor along with narrative, capability statements, structure definition, questionnaires, document bundles and composition. It may also refer to transactions in other implementation guides.
- [**Logical Models**](logical-models.html) - A StructureDefinition resource that describes data element definitions and their associated rules of usage, derived from the data dictionary in the L2.
- [**Indicators and Measures**](indicators-measures.html) - A thematic list of indicators defined in the implementation guide that link to L1 and L2 guidance documents.
