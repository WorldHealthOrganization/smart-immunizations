          In polio-endemic countries and in countries at high risk of importation and subsequent spread of polio, WHO recommends a bOPV birth dose (zero dose) followed by the primary series of 3 bOPV doses and 2 IPV doses. The zero dose of bOPV should be administered at birth, or within the first week of life, to maximize seroconversion rates following subsequent doses and to induce mucosal protection before enteric pathogens may interfere with the immune response. 
Additionally, a birth dose of bOPV administered while infants are still protected by maternally_x0002_derived antibodies (up to 6 months) may prevent vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP).
