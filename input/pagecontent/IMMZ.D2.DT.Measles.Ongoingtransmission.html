          In countries with ongoing transmission in which the risk of measles mortality remains high, MCV1 should be given at 9 months of age.
As a general rule, live vaccines should be given either simultaneously or at intervals of 4 weeks. An exception to this rule is oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), which can be given at any time before or after measles vaccination without interference in the response to either vaccine.

          An additional dose of MCV should be administered to children infected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) following immune reconstitution. If CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are monitored, an additional dose of MCV should be administered when immune reconstitution has been achieved (e.g. when the CD4+ T lymphocyte count reaches 20–25%). Where CD4+ T lymphocyte monitoring is not available, children should receive an additional dose of MCV 6–12 months after initiation of HAART.
