This page includes a depiction of end-users and related stakeholders as introduced in the [WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunizations](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/380303).

The specific roles and demographic profile of the personas will vary depending on the setting, the generic personas are based on the WHO core competencies and credentials of different health worker personas.

Illustrative examples of immunization user personas for individuals are included in the [Better Immunization Data (BID) Initiative Product Vision](https://www.path.org/resources/product-vision-for-the-better-immunization-data-bid-initiative/).

### Targeted generic personas

The targeted personas for the Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunizations are
health professionals operating in care settings that are able to provide
the required essential interventions for immunization delivery. Their
key competencies are defined in the following table.

In addition to the targeted personas detailed in Table 2, there may be value in exploring other health worker occupational groups and stakeholders within the context of immunization services, such as caregiver or child. However, these were not identified as the central personas for the data and decision-support content. Additional related personas are listed in the Table 3 of the DAK.
