## Indicators and Measures

The FHIR Measure is used to describe the indicator in a computable format. These indicators may be aggregated automatically from the digital tracking tool to populate a digital health management information system (HMIS).

Measures included in this implementation guide are listed in the [Artifact Index - Measures](artifacts.md)

For the operational descriptions of indicators and references, see the [WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunizations](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/380303), including Web Annex C of the DAK. Summary indicator content from the DAK is also represented in the [Indicators and Performance Metrics](indicators.md) page.
