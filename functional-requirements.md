## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the capabilities the system must have in order to meet the end-users’ needs and achieve tasks within the business process.

These requirements are taken from Component 8 and Web Annex D of the [WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunizations](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/380303).

Please note that these are not exhaustive lists and should be modified according to context and user persona needs
