## Indicator and Performance Metrics

This page includes indicators and performance metrics that would be aggregated from core data elements identified and is extracted from the [WHO Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunizations](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/380303).

For full operational descriptions of the indicators included and their references, see Web Annex C of the DAK. For machine-readable representations, see the [Indicators and Measures](indicators-measures.md).

These indicators may be aggregated automatically from the digital tracking tool to populate a digital health management information system (HMIS).

| For national or programmatic level tracking, it may be recommended for countries to monitor immunization coverage for individual doses and/or for additional vaccines that are currently not monitored globally (i.e. cholera, TBE). For such, the following indicator template can be used: | | | | | | | | | |
| IMMZ.IND.[serial number] | Immunization coverage for [antigen name (e.g. cholera)] vaccines | The percentage in the target population who have received [number of dose(s) (e.g. 1)] of [antigen name (e.g. cholera)] vaccine during the reporting period | Number of [antigen name (e.g. cholera)] dose [dose number (e.g. 1)] administered through routine services during the reporting period | COUNT of immunization events WHERE "Vaccine type" = "[antigen name (e.g. cholera)] vaccines" for the [dose number (e.g. 1st)] dose in the primary series AND "Date and time of vaccination" is during the reporting period | Number in target group | As defined by the Member States | Administrative areaSexAge in yearsAge group (depending on schedule) | [Add appropriate reference] | [Add any additional notes or comments] |
| IMMZ.IND.[serial number] | Simultaneous vaccination coverage for [antigen name A (e.g. penta)] and [antigen name B (e.g. OPV)] | The percentage in the target population who have received both [number of dose of antigen A (e.g. 3rd dose)] of [antigen name A (e.g. penta)] and [number of dose of antigen B (e.g. 3rd dose)] of [antigen name B (e.g. OPV)] on the same date | Number of [antigen name A (e.g. penta)] dose [dose number (e.g. 3)] administered on the same date of [antigen name B (e.g. OPV)] dose [dose number (e.g. 3)] | COUNT of immunization events WHERE "Vaccine type" = "[antigen name A (e.g. pentavalent)] vaccines" for the [dose number (e.g. 1st)] dose in the primary series AND "[antigen name B (e.g. OPV)] vaccines" for the [dose number (e.g. 1st)] dose in the primary series AND "Date and time of vaccination" is on the same date | Number in target group | As defined by the Member States | Administrative areaSexAge in yearsAge group (depending on schedule) | [Add appropriate reference] | [Add any additional notes or comments] |
| IMMZ.IND.[serial number] | Timeliness of vaccination for [number of dose(s) (e.g. 1 dose)] of [antigen name (e.g. cholera)] | The percentage in the target population who have received the [number of dose(s) (e.g. 1)] dose of the [antigen name (e.g. cholera)] vaccine by [age defined by the Member State (e.g. 12 months of age)] | Number of clients who received [number of dose(s) (e.g. 1)] dose of the [antigen name (e.g. cholera)] vaccine by [age defined by the Member State (e.g. 12 months of age)] | COUNT of clients WHERE  "Vaccine type" = "[antigen name (e.g. cholera)] containing vaccines" for the [dose number (e.g. 1st)] dose in the primary series AND "Age" is within [age defined by the Member State (e.g. 12 months of age)] | Number in target group | As defined by the Member States | Administrative areaSexAge in yearsAge group (depending on schedule) | [Add appropriate reference] | The time defined by the Member State needs to be less than the age included in the coverage estimation. For example, in a schedule DTP3 of 6 months. If the country considers the coverage doses of DTP3 received before 1 year, the time used to define timely doses for DTP3 should be 8 months.[Add any additional notes or comments] |
| IMMZ.IND.[serial number] | Immunization coverage for complete schedule of [antigen name A, antigen name B, antigen name C, etc. (e.g. BCG, penta1, penta2, penta3, OPV1, OPV2 and OPV3)] | The percentage in the target population who have received the complete immunization schedule consisting of [antigen names and dose numbers (e.g. BCG, penta1, penta2, penta3, OPV1, OPV2 and OPV3)] by the recommended age | Number of clients who have completed the immunization schedule consisting of [number of dose of antigen A] of [antigen name A], [number of dose of antigen B] of [antigen name B], [number of dose of antigen C] of [antigen name C], [number of dose...] of [antigen name...] during reporting period | COUNT of clients who received  "Vaccine type" = "[antigen name A] containing vaccines" for the [dose number (e.g. 1st)] dose in the primary series, "Vaccine type" = "[antigen name B] containing vaccines" for the [dose number] dose in the primary series,  "Vaccine type" = "[antigen name...] containing vaccines" for the [dose number...] dose in the primary series AND "Date and time of vaccination" is during the reporting period | Number in target group | As defined by the Member States | Administrative areaSexAge in yearsAge group (depending on schedule) | [Add appropriate reference] | The moment in the client's life that this indicator is going to be messured (e.g. 12 months) needs to be defined by the Member State and the "complete schedule" should include all the doses of vaccines included before that moment.[Add any additional notes or comments] |
